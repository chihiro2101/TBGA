Japanese chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga revealed the drug favipiravir is available at any time to World Health Organisation. 
The drug was developed to treat new and re-emerging strains of flu. 
It was approved by the Japanese health ministry in March. 
It comes as the first British victim , nurse William Pooley , 29 , was airlifted back to the UK from Sierra Leone where he was helping treat victims. 
Mr Pooley arrived back to London in an isolation sack and was transferred to a special unit at The Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead. 
Firm responsible for Zmapp , the experimental drug used to treat U.S. victims Dr Kent Brantly and aid worker Nancy Writebol , says stocks are exhausted. 
NHS chiefs said it is working to source remaining doses for Mr Pooley after WHO said it is ethical to use experimental drugs given scale of the outbreak
